  You may have a claim against your landlord for problems in your home over the last
  6 years, whether they are currently repaired or not. For certain problems, you may only
  have a claim for the last 4 years.
  
  Your landlord may have to pay you the difference between the value of your home in full
  repair and the value of your home with the bad conditions. For very serious problems
  that made the apartment unlivable, you may be entitled to 1 to 3 months of rent.
