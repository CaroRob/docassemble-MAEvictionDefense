mandatory: True
question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both the tenant and the landlord have the right to have a jury decide the facts of their case instead of 
  a judge. This is your only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).
  
  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experiences.
  1. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  1. You still can waive your jury trial right later. Claiming a jury trial also does not
     stop you from reaching an agreement with your landlord.
  
  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent while you
  are waiting for the jury trial to be scheduled. 
  Most tenants who receive assistance in Greater Boston Legal Services clinics request a 
  jury trial.
