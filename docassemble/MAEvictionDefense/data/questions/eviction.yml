  About this interview
subquestion: |
  This interview was created by Massachusetts legal aid programs as a free
  service for tenants who are facing eviction.
  It will help you complete forms that you must deliver to your landlord and 
  to the court. It is estimated to take about 25 minutes. 
  
  At the end of the interview and when you have delivered the forms to the proper
  place:
  
  1. You may better understand your legal rights and defenses.
  1. You may get more information from your landlord to help you prepare for court.
  1. Your court appearance may be delayed by two weeks.
  
  Words that you may not understand will be {highlighted in green}. Click on a green
  word to learn more. Click the "[Help]" button at any time to learn more about this
  interview. If "Help <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></i>"

  Please locate the Summons and Complaint and the Notice to Quit for your case

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both the tenant and the landlord have the right to have a jury decide the facts of their case instead of 
  a judge. This is your only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).
  
  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experiences.
  1. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  1. You still can waive your jury trial right later. Claiming a jury trial also does not
     stop you from reaching an agreement with your landlord.
  
  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent while you
  are waiting for the jury trial to be scheduled. 
  Most tenants who receive assistance in Greater Boston Legal Services clinics request a 
  jury trial.
