question: Reason for eviction

fields: 
  - Choose all that apply.: eviction_all_reasons
    datatype: checkboxes
    none of the above: False
    choices:
      - My landlord says I owe rent.: nonpayment
      - My landlord says I did something wrong other than owe rent. For example, a noise complaint or damage to the apartment.: fault  
      - My landlord doesn't want to rent to me any longer but it's not because of something I did. (For example, my landlord wants to rent to a family member.): nofault

      - I don't know. : unsure
help: |
  Look carefully at your notice to quit or notice to terminate tenancy. Choose the 
  best answer you can from the information on the notice. There is no special
  language that your landlord must use when telling you the reason for the eviction.
  It can sometimes be written in a confusing or unclear way.
