question: What protected class do you fall under?
subquestion: |
  If you are a member of a "protected class," meaning that you are a person of color, have Section 8, receive public assistance, or fit into one of the other protected categories, you may be at risk of discrimination. There are steps you can take, however, to protect yourself. People with physical and mental disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations in any housing transaction.
