    This interview is meant to help Massachusetts residents respond to an eviction.
    
    You will have a chance to explain why you should not be evicted. You may also
    be able to sue your landlord for problems such as unrepaired bad conditions. If you
    are using the interview before the deadline, your court date will be postponed
    by two weeks.
    
    At the end of this interview, you will have documents that you can file in court. You will also need to 
    give a copy of the documents to your landlord or your landlord's attorney.
